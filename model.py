Dynamic Graph CNN with k-nearest neighbor formulation and edgeconv formulations to predict pressure distributions
over car geometries

Each car geometry is fed in form of a point cloud, which goes through 3 DGCNN layers. This is followed by concatenation
of features and a final convolutional layer. 

The embedded geometry is followed by layers of an MLP to learn the relationship between the embedding and the pressure distribution

inputs are a 3d tensor with spatial coordinates and ouputs a one dimensional pressure , along with 
embedded features in form of a 2D tensor from feature concatenation of the complex 3D shapes.
